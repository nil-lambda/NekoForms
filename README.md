# NekoForms is currently broken
 I am aware that the program is not functioning correctly due to certain APIs no longer working and some endpoints being removed. I will do my best to update the project, removing the deprecated APIs and replacing them with functional ones in due course.

# Warning
 The application contains NSFW content!

# NekoForms
 The application uses multiple site API's to take images of nekos and display them in a new forms. That's how it got its name - NekoForms! If you like the application don't hesitate to star it, it helps me a lot!
 
# Features
 The newest NekoForms (2.0) is made using .NET 6.0 for optimal performance. Currently it features:
 * Image generation from 3 different API's (Nekos.Life / Nekos.Fun / Hmtai)
 * Fixed window dimensions.
 * Dynamic window dimensions.
 * Better and simplified code.
 * Better code structure.
 * Debug window to be in touch with what's happening.
 * Debug exporter on exit. In case of issues open an issue and attach the file.
 
 Images are also no more being locally downloaded but this will be made into a option soon!
 
# To be added
 Some features from the old NekoForms version are going to be added very soon (including some new ones):
 - [ ] Image profile
 - [ ] Image preview
 - [ ] Duplicate exlude
 - [ ] Local image download

# Video example
 Previews from older versions. They will be updated soon as well!
